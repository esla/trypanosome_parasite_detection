# trypanosome_parasite_detection

This repository contains code for training and evaluating object detectors for trypanosome parasite detection. 
It contains two directories: [yolov7](yolov7) and [retinanet_and_fasterrcnn](retinanet_and_fasterrcnn). 
The [yolov7](yolov7) code is based on the YOLOv7 implementation at 
[https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7), while the 
[retinanet_and_fasterrcnn](retinanet_and_fasterrcnn) is an adapted version of the [torchvision 
template](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/main/references/detection) code for object detection.
